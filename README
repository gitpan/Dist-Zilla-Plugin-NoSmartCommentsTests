NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NoSmartCommentsTests - Make sure no Smart::Comments
    escape into the wild

VERSION
    version 0.006

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

        [NoSmartCommentsTests]

DESCRIPTION
    This is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles, providing the
    following file:

      xt/release/no-smart-comments.t - test to ensure no Smart::Comments

NOTE
    The name of this plugin has turned out to be somewhat misleading, I'm
    afraid: we don't actually test for the _existance_ of smart comments,
    rather we ensure that Smart::Comment is not used by any file checked.

SEE ALSO
    Smart::Comments, Test::NoSmartComments
