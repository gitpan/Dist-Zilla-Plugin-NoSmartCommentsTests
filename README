NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NoSmartCommentsTests - Make sure no Smart::Comments
    escape into the wild

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.007 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NoSmartCommentsTests - released December 02, 2014
    as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-NoSmartCommentsTests.

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

        [NoSmartCommentsTests]

DESCRIPTION
    This is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles, providing the
    following file:

      xt/release/no-smart-comments.t - test to ensure no Smart::Comments

NOTE
    The name of this plugin has turned out to be somewhat misleading, I'm
    afraid: we don't actually test for the _existance_ of smart comments,
    rather we ensure that Smart::Comment is not used by any file checked.
